					  <h1>ENCRYPTION <small>What is it?</small></h1>
					</div>
					<p>Encryption is the means of keeping data safe by encoding it such that only the intended parties can read it. Even though the encryption methods are publically known, the security lies in the key used in the cipher. Online services such as online banking, social media, and cloud storage use encryption all the time by encoding data before sending it from machine to machine.</p>

					<p>We conducted a research based project on ciphers intended to educate ourselves and the audience of the basics of cryptography. We implemented a few popular ciphers from scratch in python to understand how they function.</p> 

					<ul>
						<li>Caesar - Simple Shift cipher</li>
						<li>Vigen&egrave;re - Multiple Shift cipher</li>
						<li>Hill - Matrix key cipher</li>
					</ul>

					  <h1>CRYPTANALYSIS <small>How does it work?</small></h1>
					</div>

					<div class="col-md-7" id="analysis-col">
						<p>Cryptanalysis is the study of weaknesses of a cipher that will allow the plaintext to be acquired from the ciphertext without knowledge of the key. We analyzed how to break each of the three historical ciphers.</p>

						<p>A shared key is used to encrypt the plaintext to ciphertext and decrypt the ciphertext to plaintext. The format of the key depends on the implementation of the cipher. For example, a Caesar key is a number 1-26, the Vigenere key is an alphabetic string, and the Hill key is a square matrix. The typical approach is to brute force a set of reasonable keys and then perform statistical analysis on the letter combinations of the plaintext in question. </p>

						<p>The frequency distribution of letter combinations is compared to that of the English language. Which ever plaintext receives the highest score is most probable to be English. An example of this is shown to the left with the Caesar Cipher.</p>
